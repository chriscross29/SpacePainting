# SpacePainting
This assignment is part of the Programming (2IP90) course at TU/e. The task was to create a program that draws a random picture on the screen that consists of different geometric shapes with different colors. A space-themed painting was created using elements such as rockets, planets, stars, and asteroids.

Following the assignment's completion, I made code modifications to enhance the visual aesthetics of the painting. You can find pictures of the old and new paintings in the repository.
